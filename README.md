# js-calculator
A simple calculator made with Javascript.

The result will be at the console. If you write "no", the calculation will stop, in case you want to restart, just refresh the page.
I could make it appear in the screen, but feels good to know that I made it in 1 hour and a half or something like this, it's okay the way that it is
and I will just procceed studying (maybe I will create more versions with a cleaner code).
It's been about one or two weeks since I started studying JS. Thanks for your support S2.
